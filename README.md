MacJags
=======

MacJags is a Mac OS X GUI for Bayesian analysis. It is intended to be a Mac replacement for WinBUGS and OpenBUGS and is based on the [JAGS](http://www-fis.iarc.fr/~martyn/software/jags/) library. For more information on using MacJags for Bayesian modeling, refer to the JAGS documentation.

Note that MacJags is in an indefinite state of pre-alpha release. It is *not* under active development. If you would like a more stable alternative, consider using [WinBUGS](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/) or [OpenBUGS](http://openbugs.info/) with [WineBottler](http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/). A tutorial is available [on my blog](http://www.aidanfindlater.com/installing-openbugs-in-mac-os-x-using-winebottler).

License information is available in LICENSE. Note that JAGS itself is released under a separate license from this software.
